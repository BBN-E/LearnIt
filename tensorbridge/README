To connect a Java and a Tensorflow program follow the following steps:

1. Create a class with a "decode" method which takes a single JSON object as a parameter and returns whatever JSON the server should return. It should also have a shutdown method where you release any resources which need releasing
2. On the Java side, instantiate a TensorFlowDecoderWrapper according to the guidance in its Javadoc
